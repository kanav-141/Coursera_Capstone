Governments and their citizens can benefit from a technology that can predict the likely severity of a potential accident given certain parameters (e.g weather). Therefore, when certain conditions conducive to severe accidents present themselves, road users can adjust their behaviours to minimize the risk of a severe collision. This could lead to less severe road accidents, which would benefit society as a whole."
